# Purpose
Firefox extension for staying on task.
## How it works
I've used productivity extensions in the past to keep me focused and to block distractions. Many of these have a timer for "cheat sites" -- before the timer goes off, you can spend as much time on those websites as you want, but after your time's up, the site's blocked for the rest of the day. This sucks because sometimes I will later have a legitimate reason to get back on the blacklisted site. Then I get frustrated and disable the extension altogether, which inevitably leads me to get distracted all over again.

I wrote this extension to mitigate this problem. When you enter a blacklisted site, you're asked to give a rationale for your visit. It can be anything -- maybe you have a legitimate reason, or maybe you're just taking a break. Then, every two minutes, you're forced to retype that reason. That way, if you're on the site for productivity, you won't get carried away; and if you're there to take a break, it'll eventually get annoying enough to make you snap out of it.

To add a site to the blacklist, click on the extension button (located in the toolbar in the top-right area of the browser). It'll confirm that you want to blacklist the current site. Remember that you can't un-blacklist a site! Or else that would defeat the point of it all.
